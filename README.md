### FEUP 1st year 2nd semester - Prog  
2nd project - 'Agência de Viagens “NiceHolidays”'  
  
All the requeired funcionalities for the project have been implemented.  
We choose to use a struct for the agency (although, the dates, addresses, travel packs and clients are classes).
We added more funcionalities to the project:  
    -The user can choose to also see the unavailable travel packs printed;  
    -Many checks for the user input to given/written in the correct way;  
    -Extensive use of exceptions to make the program flow better
